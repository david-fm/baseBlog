## Why Lambda Calculus?
Before delving into Lambda Calculus, let's first explore its benefits and the scenarios where it can prove valuable.

Lambda Calculus is a neat and simple way to represent a Turing machine equivalent, so learning it will help you to understand computation in a more abstract way. It is also a good way to understand the basics of functional programming and how it works under the hood, making you more proficient when coding on languages where functional programming is available.

Furthermore for those who are interested in develop a new programming language or a new type system, Lambda Calculus is a good starting point to test your ideas.

Now you can start learning Lambda Calculus.

## What is Lambda Calculus?

> Lambda Calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and [substitution](#substitution). 

But what does that mean? Let's define some terms.

## What is not Lambda Calculus?

- Lambda Calculus does not have numbers, strings, booleans, etc.
- Lambda Calculus does not have conditionals, loops, etc.
- Lambda Calculus does not have predefined functions.

## Definitions

> **Formal system**: A formal system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some inference rules that tell us how to manipulate the symbols.

- <b>Symbols</b>: A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship.
- <b>Inference Rules</b>: An inference rule is a logical rule that is used to deduce one statement (called the conclusion) from one or more other statements (called the premises).

> **Variable Binding**: In computer programming, variable binding is the association of a name to a value.
>
>   Example: `x = 5`

> **Substitution**: A substitution instance of a formula or term is a formula or term constructed from it by replacing all variables with terms.

## Syntax

As long as we have a formal system, we need to define the syntax of the system. In other words, we need to define the symbols and the rules of the system.

I will begin by defining the symbols of the system.

### Symbols
λx is equivalent to *function(x)*

#### Alphabet

- **variables**:  <Latex formula='a_0, a_1, ...'/>
    - <b>free variables</b>: 
    
        <Latex formula='FV(x)=\{x\}'/> <br/>
        <Latex formula='FV(M N)=FV(M)\cup FV(N)'/> <br/>
        <Latex formula='FV(λx.M)=FV(M)−\{x\}'/> <br/>
    - <b>bound variables</b>: 
        
            <Latex formula='BV(x)=\emptyset'/> <br/>
            <Latex formula='BV(M N)=BV(M)\cup BV(N)'/> <br/>
            <Latex formula='BV(λx.M)=BV(M)\cup\{x\}'/> <br/>

- **improper symbols**: <Latex formula='λ, ., ( ), =, \rarr'/>
- **equality**: <Latex formula='='/>
- **redution**: <Latex formula='\rarr'/>

#### Terms

- **variable**: Any variable is a term.
- **application**: <Latex formula='M N'/> where <Latex formula='M'/> and <Latex formula='N'/> are terms.
- **abstraction**: <Latex formula='\lambda x . M'/> where <Latex formula='x'/> is a variable and <Latex formula='M'/> is a term.

### Rules
#### Formulas

They are the

Given that <Latex formula='M'/> and <Latex formula='N'/> are terms, then:

- **equality**: <Latex formula='M = N'/>
- **reduction**: <Latex formula='M \rarr N'/>

#### Substitution

As said in [definitions](#definitions), a substitution instance of a formula or term is a formula or term constructed from it by replacing all variables with terms. They are the building blocks of [reductions](#reductions).

Given <Latex formula='(λy.M)[N/x]' /> with <Latex formula='x\ \bcancel{=} \ y'/>
- if <Latex formula='y\ \bcancel{\in} \ FV(N)'/> and <Latex formula='x\ \bcancel{\in} \ FV(M)'/>
    - Then we can substitute <Latex formula='x'/> for <Latex formula='N'/> in <Latex formula='M'/> and get <Latex formula='M[N/x]'/>
- in other case
    - Select a new variable <Latex formula='z'/> such that <Latex formula='z\ \bcancel{\in} \ FV(M)\cup FV(N)'/>
    - Apply the substitution <Latex formula='(λz.M[z/y])[N/x]'/>

### Reductions

They are the base rules of the λ calculus, there are three basic reductions:

- **α-reduction**: <Latex formula='λx.M \rarr λy.M[y/x]'/> 

    You can think of it as a variable renaming.

- **β-reduction**: <Latex formula='(λx.M)N \rarr M[N/x]'/>

    You can think of this as a function call.
    ```python
    def f(x):
        return x + 1
    
    f(5) # 6
    ```

- **η-reduction**: <Latex formula='λx.Mx \rarr M'/> if <Latex formula='x\ \bcancel{\in} \ FV(M)'/>

    You can think of this as the mathematical property:
    <Latex formula='\forall x\  fx=gx'/> entonces <Latex formula='f=g'/>

### Equality

> It is said that two terms are equal if they can be reduced to the same term.

- The result of equal terms is the same.

<Latex formula='\lambda x.x = \lambda y.y'/> pero <Latex formula='\lambda x.x\ \bcancel{\equiv}\ \lambda y.y'/>
