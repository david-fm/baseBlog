Before diggin into functional programming, we need to understand what is a lambda calculus, and what is a lambda function.

## What is Lambda Calculus?

> **Lambda calculus** is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.

It is created on the base of the lambda function **位** (lambda), which is equivalent to a function. Its syntax is the following:

```python
位x.x
```

Where **x** is the parameter of the function, and `.x` is the body of the function. The result of this function is the parameter itself. This is the equivalent of the following function in python:

```python
def identity(x):
    return x
```

### Restrictions

The lambda calculus has some restrictions, which are the following:
- It only has one parameter.

    If you need more than one parameter, you can use currying: *位x.位y.xy*.

- It can't predefined constants (like 1, 2, 3, etc).
- It can't have assignments (*x=z*). 
- It can't have predefined functions (like *def sum(x, y): return x + y*).

The definition (through functions) of all common constants and arithmetic and list manipulation functions (combinators) is allowed.


## What is Functional Programming?

> Functional programming takes its inspiration from lambda calculus. It is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
